## OrigARmi
- **Device**: Microsoft HoloLens
- **Technologies used**: Unity, MRTK
- **Languages**: C#

OrigARmi allows anyone to learn to fold complex origami without being confused with complex symbols. The virtual origami is positioned such that the user can both comfortably follow the animated instruction while also folding the real origami at the same time. The instruction animations are implented in 3D for users to better visualize and observe the angles that are usually hard to see when following 2D instructions or youtube videos. It is also possible to skip to a particular instruction step or go to previous steps by clicking the arrows on the screen.

Additionally, to leverage the Hololens' capability and for a better user experience, this application can detect simple audio commands e.g. to go back and forth between steps. This way they can navigate between the steps without having to take their hands off of the origami paper. The animations can also be replayed for each step so that users can fold the origami at their own pace.

## PingLaPong
- **Technologies used**: ReactJS, Spring

<img src="https://i.imgur.com/RpZ5Rdb.png" width="400">

PingLaPong is a capstone project that my team built as part of a GovTech project. It is a full suite team management system that is designed and developed in Microservice architecture where it consists of user management, calendar, venue, and notification service. My role in the team was mainly to build the frontend of this system. I set up the frontend using a [Boilerplate](https://github.com/react-boilerplate/react-boilerplate) and had to familiarize with the different libraries in a short period of time. Libraries that we used include: [Redux-saga](https://redux-saga.js.org), [Semantic UI](https://react.semantic-ui.com) and [Redux](https://redux.js.org) amongst many others. We implemented the signup feature in a way that only allows people who are invited (with a unique url) to sign up. Users can also signup and login with third party applications such as google login. In this process, both the user and team lead have to do a confirmation in their emails before the user can access the portal. For the calendar feature, users are not only able to CRUD their own events (leave, WFH, etc) in the calendar, but they can also view their teammates' calendars. Team leads are then able to track their team members' progress and workflow.

My team won the Best Project Award at the 15th STePS - NUS School of Computing Term Project Showcase (19-20 Semester 1)
