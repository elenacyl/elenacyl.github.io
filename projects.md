OrigARmi allows anyone to learn to fold complex origami without being confused with complex symbols. The virtual origami is positioned such that the user can both comfortably follow the animated instruction while also folding the real origami at the same time. The instruction animations are implented in 3D for users to better visualize and observe the angles that are usually hard to see when following 2D instructions or youtube videos. It is also possible to skip to a particular instruction step or go to previous steps by clicking the arrows on the screen.

Additionally, to leverage the Hololens' capability and for a better user experience, this application can detect simple audio commands e.g. to go back and forth between steps. This way they can navigate between the steps without having to take their hands off of the origami paper. The animations can also be replayed for each step so that users can fold the origami at their own pace.
