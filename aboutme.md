### Introduction
Hello! My name is **Elena Choo**. I just graduated from **National University of Singapore (NUS)** with a **Bachelor of Computing in Information Systems (Honours)**. I was part of the **NOC program (NCTO Batch 1)** and spent my third year of school in **Toronto, Canada**. Very recently, I started my first full time job as a **Software Engineer at BitTitan**!

### Interests
I like to dabble with all sorts of new technologies and things that I find fascinating. I also play sports - ping pong and hiking and frisbee (occasionally). Sometimes when I feel like it, I try to bake food that I have strong cravings for. 

On lazier rest days I binge-watch netflix and take care of my dogs and my succulent.
