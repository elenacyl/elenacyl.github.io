### Introduction
Hello! My name is Elena Choo. I just graduated from National University of Singapore (NUS) with a Bachelor of Computing in Information Systems (Honours). I was part of the NOC program (NCTO Batch 1) and spent my third year of school in Toronto, Canada. Very recently, I started my first full time job as a Software Engineer at BitTitan!

### Interests
I like to dabble with all sorts of new technologies and things that I find fascinating. I also play sports - ping pong and hiking and frisbee (occasionally). Sometimes when I feel like it, I try to bake food that I have strong cravings for. 

On lazier rest days I binge-watch netflix and take care of my dogs and my succulent.
